[VLANS]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat, VLAN and
# VXLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only local networks may be created.

# Default: network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999

[DATABASE]
# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# sql_connection = mysql://root:nova@127.0.0.1:3306/quantum_linux_bridge
# Replace 127.0.0.1 above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main quantum server. (Leave it as is if the database runs on this host.)

# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implies an infinite retry count
# sql_max_retries = 10
# Database reconnection interval in seconds - if the initial connection to the
# database fails

[LINUX_BRIDGE]
# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST change this to
# 'vlan' or 'vxlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges in [VLANS] section or
# network_vni_ranges in [VXLAN] section in order for tenant networks to
# provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none' to disable creation of
# tenant networks.
#
# Default: tenant_network_type = local
# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical
# network names to the agent's node-specific physical network
# interfaces to be used for flat, VLAN and VXLAN networks. All physical
# networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have
# mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.
#
# Default: physical_interface_mappings =
# Example: physical_interface_mappings = physnet1:eth1

[AGENT]
# Agent's polling interval in seconds
polling_interval = 2

[SECURITYGROUP]
# Firewall driver for realizing quantum security group function
firewall_driver = quantum.agent.linux.iptables_firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver

[VXLAN]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<vni_min>:<vni_max> tuples enumerating ranges
# of VNI IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat,
# VLAN and VXLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of
# VNI IDs are available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type
# is 'vxlan'. If empty, only local networks may be created.
# Please note that for VXLAN network_vni_ranges are unique for all physical
# networks.
#
# Default: network_vni_ranges =
# Example: network_vni_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999

# TTL for vxlan interface protocol packets
#
# By default ttl is inherited from system configuration
# Default: vxlan_ttl =
# Example: vxlan_ttl = 255

# Multicast group for vxlan interface. All broadcast traffic is send
# to this multicast group address.
#
# Default: vxlan_group = 239.1.1.1
# Example: vxlan_group = 239.1.1.2

# TOS IP header for vxlan interface protocol packets
#
# By defaul tos is inherited from system configuration
# Default: vxlan_tos =
# Example: vxlan_tos = 8

# Port range for vxlan interface udp protocol packets
#
# By defaul no range is defined.
# Default: vxlan_port =
# Example: vxlan_port = 32768,65535

# Source ip address for vxlan interface udp protocol packets
#
# By defaul no source ip address is defined. Address is choosen by system
# in routing subsystem.
# Default: vxlan_local_ip =
# Example: vxlan_local_ip = 192.168.100.100
